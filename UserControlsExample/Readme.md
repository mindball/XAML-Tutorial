# User Controls
```
Logical grouping of elements into a reusable control
```

## How are UCs different from Windows and Pages
> Windows and Pages typically contain UCs
> Not the other way around
```
you cannot have a windows inside of a user control and the same goes for pages
it doesnt make sense for a UCs to contain a windows since that can be to reuse
